## The Dataset :

The data was taken from Kaggle site : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud .

The Columns do not have physical significance directly visible since as per the source (Kaggle) , the data was compressed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in order to protect the privacy of the individuals while making a realistic secnario dataset availaible to public . 

## Data Preprocessing and Visualisation :

### Correlations :

The columns do not seem to have correlations with each other , and seem to have great correlation with the Class and time variables , hence being a great indicator that simple models would be helpful here , and neural networks wont be needed hopefully . 

### Relation between target variables and columns :

A plot between different columns and amount along with different colours for target variable show that our output classes are separable by linear boundary even in case of graphing variables alone , hence __LOGISTIC REGRESSION__ will help separate the multivariable data into 2 classes .

### Class Imbalance in dataset :

This shows that we have way way less data for fraud cases than for non fraud cases , which is expected from the dataset . 

To cure imbalance , we can use undersampling or oversampling . Here , I have decided to use SMOTE to counter the class imbalance in the dataset . 

### Training the model :
I have trained a Logistic Regression Model here . The model was showing a not converging warning , so I read its documentation and added the code to make it run for 150 iterations . 

### Results from part 1 :

The F1 score came 0.99 meaning the Classifier is working great . It managed to catch 91 out of 101 frauds , thus preventing frauds 90% of the time . 
The confusion matrix , precision , recall and F1 score has been displayed for your convenience . The confusion matrix readings and the F1 show the success of the project .

### Results from part 2 :

I have also uploaded some raw code to this repository , here are the conclusions derived from it :

Frauds are time independent so we can drop time :

__Lower Dimension Visualization__ is beautiful :

I also took advice from my seniors, decided to __undersample__ the dataset since significance of the data would be more realistic if there was no synthetic dataset. 
I also decided to choose the ML model with most recall , reason being that I realized later that as a business, labelling a Non Fraud datapoint as fraudulent would be much more worse for the company, __since nobody would like their card to decline__ and people would literally stop using that credit card, so we must __focus more on achieving lower recall than only blindly improving F1 score__ . 
So I got Logistic regression as the winner again with the following results :

Other models weren't much far behind regarding performance too, but I decided to keep the final code clean and keep the trial and error part in the "raw_code" file .
